It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy,\ncashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a\nsweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice,\nsuch as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in\naddition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to\nincorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point\nof water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.\nThe result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at\nvery low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes\nmore malleable as its temperature increases.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I Love Ice Cream"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ice-cream/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
